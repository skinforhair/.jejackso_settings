2
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,250
Get your bag off the table.
People eat there.

3
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,330
They eat on plates.

4
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,170
Don't give me any crap,
Maizy.

5
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,420
l'm telling.
You said "crap."

6
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,260
There's nothing
wrong with crap.

7
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,260
Oh, really?
l thought that was a swear.

8
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,260
No.
You're thinking of shit.

9
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,640
Oh, right.

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
Do you mind?

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,190
A sixth grader
chased me on his bike,

12
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,440
and l was running.

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,940
When l got
exhausted and fell down,
he whaled me with his shoe.

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,820
Thank your parents for that.

15
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,650
How come?
lt was their brilliant
idea to move here.

16
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,280
They weren't making
enough cash in lndianapolis.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,620
Forget that we were
perfectly happy.

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,790
So thank them for getting
treated like shit every day.

19
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,700
l'm telling on that one.

20
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,410
Shut your face.

21
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,800
Your book bag
doesn't go on the floor.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,710
Always have a cow.

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,590
Your nails are digging
to my arm, God damn it!

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,050
Pick it up.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,850
You're just supposed to
open the door for us.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,890
You're not supposed to
kick us around.

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,140
l'm an American,
l have rights.

28
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,900
Maizy, did l kick you around?

29
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,190
No, but you said "shit" twice.

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,900
But only once for real.

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,990
l've got better things
to do than babysit you,
you little stain.

32
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,280
Like what?
Hang out with
friends you don't have?

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,740
Why don't you just shut up?

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,870
Want to make me?

35
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,880
When our mother figure
isn't here, l'm in charge.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,550
l'm sick of you
calling her that!

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,050
Too bad.

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,420
You moron !

39
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,010
l don't know why
we need boys at all.

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,510
They're so loud.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Shut up!

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,100
Shut up yourself!

43
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,230
We need boys
so they can grow up,

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,940
get married,
and turn into shadows.

45
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,440
Let the dog out.

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,440
Percy!

47
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,080
This is such
a wonderful dinner, Mother.

48
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,130
How do you find the time?

49
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,800
Miles.

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,970
Maizy, put that down.

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,390
Did you win in
hockey yesterday?

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,310
Hockey's been
over for two weeks.

53
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,230
l guess you don't
want a hockey stick
for your birthday.

54
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,990
You know what?

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,660
When Dad goes to New York,
l'm going to take a week
off work.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,080
So you can interview
new housekeepers?

57
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,170
l've had enough
of your ugliness.

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,170
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

59
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,510
We're all just
a little tired
of the act.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,940
This was a really good idea.

61
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,190
Thank you.

62
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,150
How's that pie?

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,490
Not bad.

64
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,370
You gonna be at work
in the morning?

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,370
l don't see
how l can avoid it.

66
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,750
You don't seem
very happy about it.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,040
All right,
if you gotta know,

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,340
l'm really not that excited
about working for
my girlfriend.

69
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,420
There. l said it.
lt's out of the way.

70
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,010
Okay, okay.
Buck, l love you.
l can't help myself.

71
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,840
l wanna get married,
l wanna have a family.

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,390
l wanna do it with you.

73
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,430
Well, you know, the clock
is ticking away here.

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,310
l would just like to
hear the pitter-patter
of tiny feet before l die.

75
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,350
l'll get you a mouse
and a piece of sheet metal.

76
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,400
Come on.
Lighten up, will you?

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,400
Don't push my button.
l'm not gonna get into this.

78
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,110
l'm not pushing your buttons.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,490
l know me,
l know what l like.

80
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,080
All right?
l like my friends.
l like my freedom.

81
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,120
l like knowing
l can throw my sticks
in the trunk of my car

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,330
and go golfing
anytime l want.

83
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,960
l don't hurt anybody.
l don't see
what the problem is.

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
That's the best formula
for loneliness l ever heard.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,050
Why are we arguing?

86
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,210
We're talking.

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,930
l said l'd be at work
in the morning.
l'll be there.

88
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,300
Okay.

89
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,180
l. . . l just
gotta get this out.

90
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,270
l mean, l know l'm harping
on something here, but,
you know,

91
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,020
just let me say it.
l mean, you know, l am. . .

92
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,860
l'm working on history.
l'm working on the past.

93
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,530
You're gonna show up for work,
you swear to God?
ln the A.M.? Promise?

94
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,530
Chanice,
l'll be honest with you,

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,160
if l could
think of an excuse
that you would buy,

96
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,280
l'd use it.

97
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,130
(RlNGlNG)

98
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,840
Hello.

99
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,760
Oh, God.

100
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,970
What?

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,600
Just a second.

102
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,060
lt's your aunt.
What happened?

103
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,940
Your Dad had a heart attack.

104
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,360
Who's going to
watch the kids?

105
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,200
Marcie.
She's right
across the street.

106
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,080
She's the last person
l'd ask for a favor.

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,040
What about the Nevilles?

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,590
Would you call them?

109
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,090
l want to leave
as soon as we can.

110
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,010
l am so helpless here.

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,850
Honey, now,
don't start getting
down on why we moved.

112
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,520
lt has nothing to
do with what happened.

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,770
Sorry.

114
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,850
Now, this is just a thought.

115
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,360
What about Buck?

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
l'm sure he'd be
glad to help out.

117
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,570
This is not the time
to discuss your brother.

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,530
l don't want him here.

119
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,280
lt's just a suggestion.

120
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,870
He doesn't have kids.
He isn't married.
He doesn't even work!

121
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,080
He's a little out there,
but he's responsible,
and he's family.

122
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,260
Buck isn't the kind of guy
l feel comfortable leaving
my kids with.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,090
The trashy people
he hangs out with.

124
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,050
That woman who sells tires.

125
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,930
The horse racing.
The gambling.

126
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,140
Can you see him in this house?

127
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,270
Okay.

128
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,810
Call the Nevilles.

129
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,900
Are we going to lndianapolis?

130
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,410
Daddy and l are.

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,080
And we're not?

132
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,450
No. l don't think
that would be a good idea.

133
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,580
Thanks.

134
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,630
l love my father very much.

135
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,050
So why did you
move away from him?

136
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,340
lf my whole family
moved away from me,

137
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,100
l'd have a heart attack, too.

138
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,270
Oh, l see.

139
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,070
Who gonna take care of us?

140
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,280
Mr. and Mrs. Neville.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,940
ls that a joke?
You don't like the Nevilles?

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,950
Their dog's a ball sniffer.

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,620
Don't talk like that.

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,740
Mr. Neville yelled
at Michael Larson

145
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,870
because the dog was
sniffing Michael's balls.

146
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,950
Don't use that word.

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,250
l don't know another word.

148
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,790
Well, l'm sure we can talk
to Mr. Neville about the dog.

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,630
Sorry, honey.
They're in Florida.

150
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,970
Okay. You get in bed.
You have to get up
for school.

151
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,050
Who's in Florida?

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,510
Get back in bed.

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,560
What's another word
for "balls"?

154
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,310
Get in bed.

155
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,390
"Nuts."

156
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,480
What do we do?

157
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,820
l don't think
we have much choice.

158
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,160
Can we trust him?

159
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,410
Yeah?

160
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,330

479
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,470
You ever hear
of a ritual killing?

480
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,180
(CONTlNUES MOCKlNG)

481
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,600
l don't get it.

482
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,150
You gnaw on her face
in public like that again,
and you'll be one.

483
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,360
Hey!

484
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,120
Are you crazy?
l can be.

485
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,790
You could have
taken his head off!

486
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,460
Yeah, but would he notice?

487
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,460
Can we get
something straight?

488
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,920
The guy's a predator,
and you're his prey.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Oh, really.
You bet.

490
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,050
And how do you know?

491
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,050
When l was his age,
l was the guy
zooming the girls like you.

492
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,470
Pretty face,
big chip on your shoulder.

493
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,020
l recommend that you
stay out of my personal life.

494
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,480
Do your parents stay out
of your personal life?

495
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,900
They don't know
my personal life.

496
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,730
Have they met twiddle dink?

497
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,990
His name is Bug.
(SCOFFS)

498
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,160
First or last?

499
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,240
First.
What's his last name, Spray?

500
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,620
You should talk, Buck.

501
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,060
No.

502
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,270
No. N-O.

503
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,150
Don't look at me like that.

504
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,480
Don't.

505
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,860
That's not fair.

506
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,200
Don't you have
a favorite doll
or something?

507
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,040
Why don't we get
one of your dolls

508
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,500
and put your dad's
pajamas on him?

509
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,620
No.

510
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,800
Your brother!
What about your brother?

511
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,640
How about the dog?
You know the dog.

512
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,140
You can't.
You just can't.

513
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,980
lt's a new law.
That's it.
lt's in the books.

514
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,820
You don't want
to sleep with me.

Can somebody get that,
please?

517
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,160
Do l have to do
everything around here?

518
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,540
MlLES: Yo.

519
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,670
ClNDY:
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

520
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,800
Fine. l'm earning my keep.

521
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,880
Uncle Buck's got me
busting my hump.

522
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,720
He says a little hard work
will put hair on my chest.

523
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
At least
l'm learning a trade.

524
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,930
That's good.

525
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,350
Grandpa's feeling
a little bit better.

526
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,890
And he sent you
big hugs and kisses.

527
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,270
Tell him to hang in there.

528
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,320
Can you get Uncle Buck?

529
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,530
Will do, chickie.

530
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,360
Mom.

531
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,700
Hi.

532
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,030
Next time you take off,
why don't you hire
a murderer to watch the house?

533
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,830
This guy's a joke.

534
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,460
Well, why don't you
just go your way
and let him go his.

535
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,710
While he systematically
dismantles my life.

536
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,090
Another drawback
is l'm a big drooler.

537
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,800
You could wake up
in the middle
of the night

538
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,420
thinking you were
asleep in a swamp.

539
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,880
Mom's on the phone.

540
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,760
Oh, good.
l'll be right there.

541
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,390
The guy took off and
left Miles and Maizy alone.

542
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,060
Plus. . .he drinks.

543
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,270
Did you brush
your teeth?

544
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,110
Yeah.
You can feel
my toothbrush.

545
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,440
l have a friend
who works at the crime
lab at the police station.

546
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,530
l could give him
your toothbrush

547
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,530
and he could run
a test on it to see if you
actually brushed your teeth

548
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,580
or just ran your toothbrush
under the faucet.

549
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,500
lf that's true,
we're gonna really have to
start brushing our teeth.

550
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,420
Hi. How are you?

551

How's everything?

552
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,760
Good. Good.

553
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,470
You sure?

554
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,220
Everything is fine here.
Everything is fine.

555
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,890
Kids are okay?

556
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,850
Kids are great!
We're having
a great time together.

557
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,400
How's your dad?

558
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,900
He's okay. He's okay.
He's getting better.
Thanks.

559
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,360
Good. Well, that's good news.
That's encouraging.

560
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,360
I've got a reaI
good feeIing about this.
He's gonna be fine.

561
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,860
l've got a few questions
for you.

562
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,370
You know, you got
an interesting set of pIates
in the Iiving room there.

563
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,450
Are they oId?

564
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Yeah.

565
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,620
They are.

566
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,040
Where would you find
something like that?

567
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,460
ln an antique shop
downtown or something?

568
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,630
ln England.

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,300
(WHlSTLES)
Everything eIse seems...

570
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,310
How many times a day
do you feed a dog
like that?

571
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,730
How many times a day
do you think he eats?

572
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
Four or five.

573
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,480
l should have told you
that he eats once.
He eats once a day.

574
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,610
Just once.

575
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,570
What does he like
to drink? Water?

576
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Yes. He drinks water.

577
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,240
l'd keep some water out.

578
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,290
l've been leaving
the toilet seats up.

579
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,330
Yeah.

580
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,290
ls that what
the blue water is?
lt's not good for him.

581
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,330
(GROANS) Oh, God.

582
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,500
That might account
for something.

583
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,210
Nothing.

584
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,510
Just an odd coloration
out on the grass.

585
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,840
Buck, um. . .

586
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,810
l just want you to know

l. . .
l don't know
how to work it,

622
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,650
so l was kicking it
and swearing at it,

623

an uncommon thing to do.

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,510
you low-life, lying,
four-flushing sack of shit.

Let's go out
to the car, huh?

799
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,250
Why?

800
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,670
What do you mean,
why?

801
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,760
Not now.

802
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,840
lt's fine.

803
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,010
lt's not fine.

804
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,970
Why not?

805
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,640
l just don't
feel right yet.

806
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,230
You ever going
to feel right?

807
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,990
l don't get
where we're going.

808
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,070
l told you 25 times.
We're going to pick up Tia.

809
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,080
She's at
a cheerleader's house
having dinner.

810
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,450
Well, so she says.

811
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,370
Since when do cheerleaders
live in the woods?

812
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,130
Come on.
l'll take you home now.

813
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,050
l don't want to go home.

814
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,550
l'm okay.

815
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,470
Sure?

816
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,230
Trust me.

(CAR BACKFlRES)

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,580
Shit!
Shit!

819
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,550
Well, well, well.

820
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,680
They certainly are scraping
the bottom of the barrel
for cheerleaders these days.

821
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,980
What are you doing here?

822
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,600
We were just driving by,
going out for some ice cream.

823
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,190
Thought you might
like to join us.

824
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,190
l said l would
be home at 1 0:00.
lt's not even 9:00.

825
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,080
Who said anything about that?
l just thought you'd like
to join us for some ice cream.

826
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,790
Maybe your Bug here
can join us.

827
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,000
We can talk about
burying the hatchet.

828
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,960
You know what
a hatchet is,
don't you, Bug?

829
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,630
lt's an ax?

830
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,290
Sort of. Yeah. Yeah.

831
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,000
l got one in the car
if you'd like to see it.

832
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,970
l'll pass.

833
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,930
Fair enough.
l like to carry it.

834
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,050
You never know
when you're gonna need it.

835
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,020
A situation
may come up, say,

836
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,810
for example, someone's been
drinking and about to drive
a loved one home,

837
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,320
then l like
to know l have it.

838
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,780
Not to kill.
(CHUCKLES)
Just to maim.

839
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,320
Take a little
off the shoulder. Woosh !

840
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,490
The elbow.

841
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,490
Shave a little meat
off the old kneecap.

842
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Whoo.

843
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,660
You got both kneecaps?

844
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,920
l like to keep mine
razor-sharp, too.

845
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,210
Sharp enough
you can shave with them.

846
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,840
Why, l've been known
to circumcise a gnat.

847
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,470
You're not a gnat,
are you, Bug?

848
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,100
Wait a minute.
Bug, gnat.

849
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,180
ls there a little
similarity there?

850
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,900
Whoa! l think there is.

851
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,780
You understand
what l'm talking about?

852

l don't think you do.

853
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,490
l'll be right back.

854
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,120
l'm sorry.

855
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,170
Look, um, l think
you'd better split.

856
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,920
You know, l don't
exactly want him going
berserk with an ax on me.

857
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,170
He's all talk.

858
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,630
Here it is.

859
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,850
Come on over. Come on,
l wanna show it to you.

860
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,310
Maybe later.

861
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,140
Okay.

862
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,240
He's gone in a few days.

863
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,740
Just relax.

864
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,070
l'll get him back.

865
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,170
That's a pretty stupid thing
to do during flu season.

866

l bet she's getting
the tongue.

Tell you what.
Let me go in
there first, okay?

870
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,250
l'll cover for you,
give you a little more
time out here to relax.

871
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,080
Okay. Mmm.
All right?

00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,800

Buck Melanoma,
Moley Russell's wart.

875
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Not her wart,
not her wart.
l'm the wart.

876

She's my tumor,
my growth, my. . .my pimple.

00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,200
l'm "Uncle Wart."

878
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,080
Buck "Wart" Russell,
that's what they call me.

879
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,870
Or melanoma head.
They'll call me that.

880
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,790
"Melanoma head's" coming.

881
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,210
l'm. . . Uncle,
Maizy Russell's uncle.

882
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,840
Her uncle.

883
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,510
Her mother set up
this conference with you.

884
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,390
l'm assistant
principal here,

885
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,850
as you've probably noticed
from the indications
on the door.

886
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,020
This door?

887
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,770
The outer door. Yes.
The outer door.

888
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,230
There's nothing on this one.

889
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,230
That's just about
enough of that.

890
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,490
Sorry.

891
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,740
l've been an educator
for 31 .3 years,

892
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,620
and in that time,
l've seen a lot
of bad eggs.

893
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,170
l say "eggs" because
at the elementary level,

894
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,340
we are not dealing with
fully developed individuals.

895
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:18,140
l see a bad egg
when l look
at your niece.

896
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,060
She is a twiddler,
a dreamer, a silly heart.

897
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,400
She is a jabberbox.

898
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,190
And frankly. . .

899
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:35,200
l don't think she takes
a thing in her life or her
career as a student seriously.

900
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,740
She's only six.

901
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,660
That is not
a valid excuse!

902
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,250
l hear that every day
and l dismiss it.

903
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,750
l don't think
l want to know
a six-year-old

904
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,880
who isn't a dreamer,
or a silly heart.

905
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,130
And l sure don't want to
know one who takes their
student career seriously.

906
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,550
l don't have a college degree

907
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,550
l don't even have a job.

908
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,680
Does anyone have a special
story about something
that happened this week?

909

Maizy.

910
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,100
My uncle was
microwaving my socks,

911
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,900
and the dog
threw up on the couch
for about an hour.

912
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,900
Honest?
Yes.

913
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,240
Why was your uncle
microwaving your socks?

914
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,820
He can't get the goddamn
washing machine to work.

915
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,490
Blasphemer!

916

BUCK: l know a good kid
when l see one.

all good kids

and convince them
they're no good.

920
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,960
You so much as scowl
at my niece or any other
kid in this school

921
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,210
and l hear about it,

922
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,800
l'm coming looking for you.

923
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,600
Take this quarter.

924

Go downtown, and have a rat
gnaw that thing off your face.

Jesus, would you
get with the program.
Bernstein is his name.

932
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,150
I forgot to give you
the message.

At least somebody knows
what they're doing down there.

935
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,030
I hate these machines.

00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,830
Look, I'm just caIIing
to say I miss you.

937
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,210
I know you probabIy
don't believe it,
but it's true.

938
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:50,830
No, I haven't been drinking.

939
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,670
I've been thinking
a Iot about you

940
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,340
and what we've talked about
the past few weeks.

941
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,420
I think about you
all the time.

942
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,880
I think about those
two dimpIes on your buns.

Dimples.

944
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,600
What did we call them?

945
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,850
The one
on the right was Lyndon,
and the left was Johnson.

946
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,770
No, that was
your boobs we did.

947
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,310
No, your boobs
were Minnie and Mickey.

948
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,020
I remember that
because of Disney WorId.

So much for promises.

1113
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,270
Does anyone in this house
know how to keep a promise?

1114
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,990
l know you two guys do.
l know.

1115
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,030
l had somewhere important
to go to tonight.

1116
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,320
This is how
l make my living.

1117
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:15,280
This was very
important to me.

1118
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,450
This was. . . My whole year
was based on tonight.

1119
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,620
lt may be peanuts
to your dad
but it's my living.

1120
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:24,750
l have no choice,
l don't care what your
parents are going to say.

1121
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,750
l have to take you
with me tonight.

1122
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,300
Where?

1123
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,090
To a racetrack.

1124
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,430
BUCK: Here we go.

1125
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:35,850
You have to go
to the bathroom?

1126
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,010
BOTH: Nope.
You sure?

1127
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,310
BOTH: Yep.

1128
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,270
This is going to
be fun, you know.

1129
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,480
Beautiful horses,
interesting people.

1130
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,060
And win some
serious coin, right?

1131
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:47,980
Well, sometimes, yeah,
but that's not the real
reason people go there.

1132
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:54,110
People go because of
the beautiful horses
and the colorful jockeys.

1133
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,280
Bug picked up Tia?

1134
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,450
Mmm-hmm.

1135
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,790
And she said
she was going
to a party.

1136
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:04,500
She said
she'd be back Sunday.
Must be a slumber party.

1137
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,550
Hop in the back.
Get your belts on.

1138
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,130
Let her go to
a party all weekend !

1139
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,340
She's old enough
to know better.

1140
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,890
Hell, she doesn't listen
to anybody anyway.

1141
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,310
Damn kids.

1144
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,850
Hi. lt's me.

1145
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,730
Buck, can't you ever
take a hint?

1146
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,360
Chanice, it's not about me.
l got a problem at the house.

1147
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,530
I need somebody
to watch the kids.

1148
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,570
No. l'll tell you
what you need.

1149
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,080
Your horse fixer's
in town

1150
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,540
and you need to
get to the track.

1151
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,660
l ran into Rog.
See, he told me
all about it.

1152
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,710
The idiot had the nerve
to ask me for a loan.

1153
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
What's the matter?

1154
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:31,170
You can't take children
with you when you're gonna
cheat on a horserace?

1155
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,840
You got some religion
out there in the 'burbs?

1156
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,550
l came close.
l had them in the car.

1157
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,930
Can we put
personal problems
aside for a second?

1158
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,300
Tia took off on me.

1159
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:43,640
l was supposed to
pick her up after school.
She wasn't there.

1160
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,890
What do you mean,
she ran away?

1161
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,940
l guess. l don't know.

1162
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,150
She's 1 5, she's angry,
she's confused,

1163
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,070
and I need to find her.

1164
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,900
Can you help me?

1165
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,030
l'm really stuck, Chanice.

1166
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,330
All right. All right.

1167
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,460
l will help you because
there's kids involved
in this.

1168
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,090
But as far as you
and l are concerned,
it is over.

1169
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,010
However it has to be.

1170
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,090
l'll be there.
Thank you.

For what it's worth,
l'm sorry.

you ought to go in there
with that hat on.

one family charity case
that loves you very much.

l'm sorry.

Hey, come on.

1273
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:05,850
Nothing to be sorry about.

1274

l'm just kind of glad
l got a chance to know
you again.

Oh, my God !
What did you do?

You shithead !

Um, do you know what
l'd like you to do?

Actually, you could be
doing both of us a favor.

l'd like you to apologize
to the lady, please.

Yeah?

01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,840
lt was halfhearted.
We'll let him.

You son of a bitch !

What do you see
in that guy anyway?

Don't answer.
You don't have to.

the confession, Tia.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

But my problems
with Buck

1328
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:18,040
go a whole lot deeper
than a misunderstanding
with a neighborlady.

1329
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,790
Don't you think
he loves you?

1330
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,130
lf he does,
he'd never say it.

1331
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,050
What if he did?

1332
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:28,380
Then l would suspect
he needed a new set of tires.

1333
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,550
Seriously.

1334
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,510
You're very sweet
to talk about this

1335
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:38,060
but l don't think
you understand
the bigger picture.

1336
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:41,850
See, Buck's a charming man
who wants to remain
a boy forever.

1337
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,350
Boy?

1338
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:46,730
And at my age,
that doesn't make for
a lasting relationship.

1339
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:52,110
l think he'd make
a wonderful husband
and father.

1340
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,570
You do?
Oh, yeah.

a great sense of humor.

put you up to this?
